Site README

Add a PDF to the site root named `resume.pdf` to host it directly.
When you share `https://<your-site-domain>/resume.pdf` the browser will open the PDF directly.

Files changed:
- Added a direct link in the navigation and a footer button in `index.html` pointing to `resume.pdf`.

Instructions:
1. Place your PDF file in the project root and name it `resume.pdf`.
2. Commit and deploy the site (for GitHub Pages or your static host). The URL `https://<your-domain>/resume.pdf` will serve the PDF with the correct Content-Type and open directly in browsers.

If you want me to add a small placeholder `resume.pdf` file to the repo, say so and I will create one.
